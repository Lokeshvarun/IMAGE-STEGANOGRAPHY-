Image steganography involves hiding text within an image so that it remains undetectable to the human eye. 
This project develops a tool to encrypt and decrypt text in PDF files by embedding it into the least significant bits of 
image pixels. It enhances security by ensuring the text is accessible only through the specified steganography technique.
